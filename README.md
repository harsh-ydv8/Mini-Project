# ðŸš˜ Automatic Number Plate Detection and Recognition System

This mini-project implements an Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system using deep learning models like MobileNet, ResNet50, and InceptionV3. It processes real-time video streams or images to detect vehicles and extract number plates, making it suitable for traffic monitoring and smart surveillance systems.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

To develop a deep learning-based ALPR system that:
- Detects vehicles and isolates number plates from video frames
- Recognizes and decodes alphanumeric text from the plates
- Compares the performance of multiple CNN architectures
- Supports real-time video input for practical deployment
